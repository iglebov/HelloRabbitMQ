# HelloRabbitMQ
Repository used for learning purposes as I continue my journey in RabbitMQ.
## Multiple terminal tabs.
I would recommend using 3 terminal tabs:
1) starting docker image
2) receiving
3) sending
## Starting on Linux
Write in Terminal: 
```
python3 start.py
```
or
```
sudo python3 start.py
```
## Receive + Send
For receiving you need to write:
```
python3 send.py
```
And sending:
```
python3 receive.py
```
